           # Or if you prefer to use your own server socket,
           # you can do something like:

           my $i2g=GMail::IMAPD->new(LogFile=>'imapd.log');

           for(;;){

           }

       This module allows users to access their Gmail account with an IMAP
       client by running a server which accepts IMAP connections.

MMEETTHHOODDSS
       new ( [ARGS] )
           Creates a new object.  Accepts arguments in key => value form.
           Valid arguments are:

                   LocalAddr       Local host bind address
                   LocalPort       Local bind port
                   Detach          Boolean to run in background.  Default = 1
                   LogFile         Path to log file
                   Debug           1 = extra information, 2 = raw socket data

       procimap ( $socket_handle )
           Directly pass a handle to the module to process IMAP commands.

NNOOTTEESS
       The IMAP and Gmail models differ. How GMail::IMAPD translates these
       differences is mostly intuitive.  For instance, folders translate to
       labels.  You can even have subfolders which translate to label names
       such as 'Work/NewProject'.  Some translations that aren't as intuitive
       are shown in the table below:

         - Copy message to folder -> Add label to message
         - Move message from Inbox to folder -> Add label to message and archive
         - Move message from folder to Inbox -> Remove label and unarchive
         - Delete message in Inbox -> Archive message
         - Delete message in folder -> Remove message label
         - Delete message in Trash -> Permanently delete message

       Messages from other IMAP accounts can be appended to the Gmail Inbox,
       and Inbox only.  The module achieves this by emailing the message to
       the Gmail account.  Therefore, the append procedure may be slow and the
       message will initially be marked unread.

       GMail::IMAPD is not fully IMAP4 compliant and has just enough function-
       ality to get by. It has been tested with Firefox, Outlook, Outlook
       Express, and mail2web.com.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
       The IMAP client is automatically subscribed to all folders/labels.
       Unsubscribe has no effect.  This is to eliminate any need for persis-
       tent server side data at the moment.

       Once a message has been moved to Trash, it cannot be un-Trashed with
       the IMAP client.  This functionality might be missing in the Mail::Web-
       mail::Gmail module or I'm not sure how to do it with the module.

       Access to large folders is slow.  To fetch simple header information
       requested by most IMAP clients (FLAGS, INTERNALDATE, etc) requires
       GMail::IMAPD to download the entire message.  Persistent message
       caching will help and is on the todo list.

       To work, GMail::IMAPD currently bundles and uses patched versions of
       UserAgent and Mail::Webmail::Gmail.  One line of UserAgent was changed
       to forward cookies to Gmail.  And, only a patched version of Mail::Web-
       mail::Gmail from the author's website works with the current version of
       Gmail.  Future versions of GMail::IMAPD will remove these patched mod-
       ules when the actual modules are updated.  For more information on this
       topic, see http://code.mincus.com/?p=2.

BBUUGGSS
       If a message is replied-to via the gmail web interface, and the reply
       is discarded, the message becomes unavaible to interfaces such as
       Mail::Webmail::Gmail.  I believe this is a Google bug.

       - Better error handling

       - Persistently cached messages, perhaps with DBI

       - IMAPS support

       - A contacts folder, perhaps containing messages with xml and vcf
       attachments

       - Copy from other IMAP accounts to any Gmail folder

       - Interface with Mail::Webmail::Yahoo ?

CCRREEDDIITTSS
       I'd like to thank Allen Holman (mincus) for the Mail::Webmail::Gmail
       module.  His module greatly accelerated the development of
       GMail::IMAPD.
